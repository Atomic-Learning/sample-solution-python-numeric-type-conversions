<p>Let's practice converting between numeric types in Python, step by step.</p>

<py-cell>
# Start with a float
my_number = 2.6
print(my_number)
</py-cell>

<p>Convert the float to an integer using <code>int()</code> (truncates toward zero).</p>
<py-cell>
round_down = int(my_number)
print(round_down)
</py-cell>

<p>Round to the nearest integer using <code>round()</code>.</p>
<py-cell>
round_nearest = round(my_number)
print(round_nearest)
</py-cell>

<p>Convert the rounded integer back to a float.</p>
<py-cell>
new_float = float(round_nearest)
print(new_float)
</py-cell>

<p>Now let's try the same steps with a negative number.</p>
<py-cell>
my_number = -3.6
print(my_number)
round_down = int(my_number)
print(round_down)
round_nearest = round(my_number)
print(round_nearest)
new_float = float(round_nearest)
print(new_float)
</py-cell>

<h2>Answers to Question</h2>

<ul>
    <li><code class="language-python">int()</code> truncates towards zero, whilst <code class="language-python">round()</code> rounds to the nearest integer.</li>
    <li><code class="language-python">round</code> always rounds to the nearest number. <code class="language-python">int</code> will round down for positive numbers and up for negative numbers (both toward zero).</li>
    <li>If you convert a float to an integer, you will lose the decimal part of the number so, even after converting back to a float, the value will be different from the original (unless the original number was already a whole number).</li>
